I've used the create-react-app tool to set up our environment. To run the code run the following commands:

`npm install` will install all the libraries 

`npm start` compiles all of your files and boots up a dev server. Browse to localhost:3000 to find your application running.

Known bugs:

1. The background image is not responsive to screen size yet.

2. The Code is all in a single file which needs to be broken into multiple file per component

In order to push it as a complete website, I'll create multiple components and create data bindings to get data from server and render components rather than simple static page.
